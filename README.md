# Sustainable Mixed-Use Development Concept

Polycarbonate greenhouse enclosing entire 60x60 plot.  Possibly include a roll-away winter insulating and reflecting
blanket and/or roll-away summer shade screen. Closable window vents for letting in pollinators etc.

Two story buildings with flat roofs covered half with solar panels, half with raised bed gardens.
Roof gardens can contain something like sweet potatoes.  Trellis over most external surface for peas
or legumes.

Polycarbonate (transparent, to limit interference with solar panels) vertical access wind turbines attached to greenhouse roof.

There are three 2 bedroom homes.  Each home is 18x26 feet and two stories.  Home contains space-saving systems such
as murphy beds and pull-down wardrobes.  Built using SIPs (structural insulated panels), airtight with HRV/ERV.
Wall-integrated television/computer screens.  Greywater recycling to reclaim shower and sink water via pump and 
filtration.  Energy-efficient appliances such as microwave, induction cooktop, convection oven, super-insulated
refrigerator and freezer.  Self-closing smart glass kitchen cabinets and storage.

Geothermal heating/cooling system buried beneath plot.  HOA fees mainly for maintaining/harvesting food forests/gardening.

Back yards are very small at 8 x 18, but have sliding privacy fences
that can be moved to combine into one 8x60 space.  Overhead trellis covers entire back yard area and grows
summer squash.

There is one 2 story commercial building, 54x12.

Food forest in middle between buildings, 54x14 feet. All around edge is circulating water 4' deep and 2' wide.
Waterfall for aeration on one end near walkway.  Small picnic table near waterfall.

Tilapia in water.  Fruit and nut trees, peas, potatoes, fruiting/nutting bushes to maximize production of space.
Water is circulated to roof gardens.
